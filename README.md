# Hello-World
Hopefully the first repository of many

My experiences with programming as a whole have not been the most satisfactory. However, I am amazed on the plethora of applications that can be created, and delighted to see how large and cooperative the worldwide community is. I want to be part of this.

This is Luis Helena Bermejo (currently they/them), I'm nonbinary trans, and I want to learn as much as possible.
